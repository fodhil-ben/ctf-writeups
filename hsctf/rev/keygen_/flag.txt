1 - i opened the file on ghidra and saw the source code 

2 - i see that the function compare if the arguments are equal to 2 and if the second argument length is 42 charecter

3 - then it xor every charecter with the the key 10

4 - after xoring the charecter it compares it with the same index charecter at a string in memory

5 - we know that's the string is in memory so i did the command

=> strings keygen | grep -E '^.{42}'

and boom we got this  =>  lfkmq<8=?=>?l'==<2'<;=>'?l<i'<l<9<h9l::::w

6 - i xored it in cyber chef with the key 10

7 - i got the flag => flag{6275745f-7768-6174-5f6c-6f636b3f0000}
