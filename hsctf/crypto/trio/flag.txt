1 - we were given a data.txt that is an encrypted message  

2 - in the code we see that the program is generating a new alphabet each letter
is replaced with a random 3 letters or numbers

3 - i tried to brute force the seed and generate the same alphabet and i failed 

4 - i was going to give up and then an idea came to me since the data.txt contain 
an encrypted text what if we replace every 3 random letters occurence with 
a real alphabet letter then we got an encrypted text but with a normal alphabet
but the alphabet is changed

5 - this reminds me of a well known cipher => substitution cipher

6 - after replacing the random alphabet to a normal alphabet i tried an online 
solver for substitution cipher i got the flag

=> flag{elephant}
