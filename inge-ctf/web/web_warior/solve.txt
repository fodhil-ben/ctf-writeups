in this challenge there is two parts
part1:
    we have the secret key on the source code 
    we decode the session and we find this value using this command
    ```
    flask-unsign --decode --cookie 'eyJpbnRlcm5hbCI6ZmFsc2V9.ZPLA6g.KC5AEbkUNbpKjQMU4a5rXiz_PrM'
    ```
    than we change the value to True to bypass this

part2:
    we can see that the app does a screenshot of the requested url 
    we want to do a screenshot of the internal file that have the flag
    so normally we would do localhost or 127.0.0.1 but we cant because there is a black list
    but since it is not a whitelist we ca bypass it easily after some research we find that 
    localho.t redirects us to localhost
    we do this 
    url=http://localho.t:5001/
    NOTE:
    we can see that it is running on port 5001 from the source code
