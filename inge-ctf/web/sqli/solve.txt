we all now sql injection but this is using mongo db which is not a relational database ??

so its no sql injection
the vulnerability is in this part of code:

```
const user = await User.findOne(q);
```

we inject this in the place of the password so it retrives the document when the password is not equal to null which will give us the desired one because 
nothing is equal to null 

payload:

{"username":"admin","password":{"$ne": null}}
