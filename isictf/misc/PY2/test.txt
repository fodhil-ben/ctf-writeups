so the vulnerability is in the float and how the program handle the the input
and make the changes to the values of "x" and "z"
so first we give it "nan" (not a number) this is how it evaluate it
and x ,z will recieve a nan
second thing we give it 10000000000000, 10000000000000

1 =>nan, nan
2 =>10000000000000, 10000000000000

flag =>ISICTF{pyth0n_c4n_b3_r34ly_w31rd_s0m3t1m3s}
