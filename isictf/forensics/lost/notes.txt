the challenge descrption sais thats it is a broken file that is missing some b

ytes in the beginning 

the first bytes from a file aka magic bytes are missing

i found an article on wikipedia about file signatures

#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures

after viewing the hexdump of the file it has this bytes at the beginning

#005a 0400 d6e6 46b4 0002 0121 0016 0000

so i searched on that article about the files that contain this bytes and i go

t this in the file signature 

#FD 37 7A 58 5A 00 => "XZ" it is a data compression file format 

added the first bytes #FD 37 7A 58

at the beginning of the file and when i see the new file format it is an XZ co

mpressed data 

i decompressed it using this command 

# xz -d file.xz

we a got a zip file we unzip it and boom we got flag.txt
