we got a google form and from the challenge description we see some letters are capitalized this letters make the word
=> "VIEW PREVIEWS RESPONSES"

after some searching i found that u can see responses in a google form by making some changemnt in the url

change viewform to => viewanalytics

and you got the flag

n00bz{7h1s_1s_th3_3nd_0f_g00gl3_f0rm5_fl4g_ch3ck3rs}
